## The electronic circuit contains a buzzer and three buttons. Each button plays a different song when pressed. The melody goes throug the buzzer. The first button plays a Godfather theme song, the second one performs Take On Me and the last one does the DOOM's OST. The sketch of the circuit can be found in the file section.
